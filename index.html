                    <hr/>
                    <p>*Did you know that cats are the number one cause of death for songbirds in Canada? That's right, they account for <a href="https://catsandbirds.ca/research/estimated-number-of-birds-killed-by-house-cats/#:~:text=Blancher%20estimates%20that%20cats%20kill,the%20rest%20by%20feral%20cats.">100 - 350 million bird deaths a year in Canada alone.</a> 
                    Keeping cats indoors can save lives, and not just for birds- indoor cats have a staggering 12-18 year lifespan in comparison to their outdoor counterparts (2-5 years). Outdoor cats are susceptible to fights, disease, and car collisions. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Cats with an adventurous spirit (like Chapeau!) can be harness trained, and supervised on a lead to ensure no birds or other small animals are harmed. Catios (outdoor enclosures for cats to keep other animals safe) are another great option.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Ensure your pets are spayed and neutered, and keep cats indoors to help keep kittens off the streets!
